# Countdown Typer #
Has your friend ever messaged you saying something like "5 mins" or "10 minutes", responding by counting them down through messages until the timer reaches 0 at which point you spam them to finish what they were doing? This application is just for you, simply run, enter the amount of time to countdown (shorthand times are supported) and press 't' to type when your on your messaging platform.
